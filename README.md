# Spam-Detection
This project delves into the realm of spam detection by employing a Neural Network model, specifically LSTM. Below is an outline of the project's architecture.

Data Collection: Load the dataset containing spam and non-spam messages.

Data Splitting: Divided data into training and testing sets

Preprocessing: Utilize techniques like tokenization to convert sentences into sequences, followed by padding to ensure uniform input lengths.

Building the model: Design the neural network architecture comprising an Input layer, Embedding layer, LSTM layer, GlobalMaxPooling, and a Dense layer utilizing the sigmoid activation function.

Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.73% on the training set and 98.8% on the validation set.
